title: About me 
---

My name is Jason Haas, and I'm a developer.  My background is electrical and system engineering, but I've transitioned over to pure software development (with the usual linux hacking work mixed in) over the last few years.  The reason I made the switch is worth a blog post in itself, which I will write at some point.

I love technology and **simple** and **intuitive** tools.  I love all tech, but my primary interest these days is Python, Git, large scale data processing, and web development.  I'm a believe in the K.I.S.S principal and UNIX design paradigms.  Each application or piece of code should do one thing, and do it really well.

## This blog

This blog is meant to share some tips & tricks I learn along the way, trying to provide unique perspectives where I can.
